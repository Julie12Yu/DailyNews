Day 9:

Microsoft and OpenAI's Stargate
====

Microsoft and OpenAI are working on a new $100 billion-dollar supercomputer.
This seems to have left most news outlets in awe, calling it a 'game-changer', or making AI 'future-proof'.
However, there arises a question of if this Stargate project is pointless - at least for its price tag.
The Green AI paper published by the Allen Institute of AI seems to indicate that more isn't always better.
At some point, the gain from training AI on more data and utilizing more parameters diminishes. 
So is creating this $100 billion-dollar supercomputer really innovation? Or is it reckless pollution?
Does this really future-proofing AI? Or does the LLM simply eat up more and more data without crediting the people it copys from (NYT vs OpenAI lawsuit)?
What is the goal behind Stargate? By utilizing 5 acres of land and 5 gigawatts of power, OpenAI and Microsoft seem to be fixated on creating more 'powerful' AI.
But what exactly will it do? Is it going to be another generative AI? Or will it actually address greater societal issues that people cannot?

We'll wait and see. According to some sources, it's expected to be completed or launched around 2028.
