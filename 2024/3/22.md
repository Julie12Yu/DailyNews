Day 5:

Logarithm? Meta?
===

First off, what is a tensor?
Mathematically, a tensor is an object that does not intrinsically change with a change in the coordinate plane. However, its components change.
For the general use of ML, a tensor is a multidimensional array. The dimensions the array has depend on the rank of the tensor, with rank 1 being a scalar, rank 2 being a vector, etc.

The Logarithm system at Meta seems to be a way to store logs in one place, making the logs easier to understand (parsing through one log to see any changes in activity).
Furthermore, the Logarithm system makes more recent logs easier/efficient to access, as those logs are more likely to be looked at.
There seems to be a lot of separation within Logarithm as well, with the ingestion (reading objects from queue) and the processing of queries being separate.
The separation allows for more scaling and preventing the two operations from impacting each other.

Ingestion nodes are replaced with the disaggregated state layers, allowing Manifold to provide its benefits.
